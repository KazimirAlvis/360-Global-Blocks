		"changelog": "<h4>1.3.24</h4><ul><li>Added an optional video title field to the Video Two Column block so editors can reinforce messaging directly above each embed.</li><li>Render the new title as an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and apply the shared heading font stack at 2.5rem/400 so typography stays consistent across the site.</li><li>Rebuilt the block assets to ship the updated markup and styling with this release.</li></ul><h4>1.3.23</h4><ul><li>Introduced a global <code>--heading-letter-spacing</code> variable that resolves to 0.5px only when the site loads the Anton heading font.</li><li>Updated every block stylesheet to consume the new variable and recompiled the build assets so frontend and editor stay in sync.</li><li>Ensured the inline CSS helper sets the same letter-spacing rules inside the editor wrapper for consistent previews.</li></ul><h4>1.3.22</h4><ul><li>Standardized typography across every block so headings and buttons now pull the theme's <code>--heading-font</code>, <code>--body-font</code>, and weight variables with a 400 fallback.</li><li>Recompiled all block bundles to ship the updated CSS alongside the source changes.</li><li>Confirmed manifests and render templates are recopied during builds so WordPress keeps registering each block after updates.</li></ul><h4>1.3.21</h4><ul><li>Streamlined the Two Column Slider on phones with tighter padding, reduced shadows, and responsive typography so the card height fits comfortably on small screens.</li><li>Automatically hides the companion slide image below tablet widths, keeping the focus on messaging while trimming excess vertical real estate.</li><li>Mirrored the mobile styling updates in the editor experience so authors preview the same stacked layout while editing.</li></ul><h4>1.3.20</h4><ul><li>Reworked the Popular Practices block so it never repeats random clinics and centers layouts gracefully when fewer than four cards are available.</li><li>Expanded clinic logo pads to 150px with matching image constraints for cleaner brand display across all column widths.</li><li>Ensured slider and popular practices block metadata stays bundled in build artifacts, preventing unsupported block notices after deployments.</li></ul><h4>1.3.19</h4><ul><li>Gave each Two Column Slider card its own background color picker so marketing teams can apply per-slide accents without custom CSS.</li><li>Capped hero-side imagery at 700px (desktop) to prevent tall uploads from stretching the layout while keeping the mobile stack flexible.</li><li>Updated the build pipeline to include the slider block metadata, preventing \"unsupported block\" warnings after future deployments.</li></ul><h4>1.3.18</h4><ul><li>Aligned the Two Column Text block preview so columns stay side-by-side inside Gutenberg while stacking only on narrower breakpoints.</li><li>Removed grid styling from WordPress wrapper classes to avoid admin conflicts without disturbing the front-end layout.</li><li>Included the required block-editor data dependencies in the build to resolve the \"This block has encountered an error\" notice after the latest enhancements.</li></ul><h4>1.3.17</h4><ul><li>Added a Two Column Text block offering twin InnerBlock-powered columns plus per-column background color controls for rich copy layouts.</li><li>Hooked the new block into the build pipeline and PHP registration so it ships with GitHub updates without extra setup.</li><li>Relaxed editor locking so the columns stay in place yet paragraph-to-list and other core transforms remain available after unlocking.</li></ul><h4>1.3.16</h4><ul><li>Persist InnerBlocks markup for the two-column block so migrated body content renders on the front end without manual fixes (re-save affected pages once after updating).</li><li>Ensure GitHub-powered updates preserve the mixed-case <code>360-Global-Blocks</code> folder name to avoid directory renames during installs.</li></ul><h4>1.3.15</h4><ul><li>Hardened the GitHub updater so extracted branch archives are always renamed to <code>360-global-blocks</code>, preventing post-update block registration issues.</li><li>Added a cleanup helper that removes stray <code>-main</code> folders before moving files into place, avoiding duplicate plugin directories.</li></ul><h4>1.3.14</h4><ul><li>Overhauled the two-column block to use native InnerBlocks content, migrating legacy body fields and sanitizing editor placeholders automatically.</li><li>Hardened the PHP render callback so nested paragraphs and lists render on the front end while stripping duplicate images, headings, and button text.</li><li>Refined block padding and typography for a tighter match between the editor preview and live layout.</li></ul><h4>1.3.13</h4><ul><li>Rebuilt the two-column slider with a horizontal track, crisp arrow artwork, improved spacing, and autoplay safeguards to eliminate flicker.</li></ul><h4>1.3.12</h4><ul><li>Unified questionnaire button copy across CTA, video two-column, two-column, and Find Doctor blocks with updated hover styling.</li><li>Flattened heading spacing for info cards and popular practices blocks to align with the latest layout polish.</li></ul><h4>1.3.11</h4><ul><li>Polished the full hero, info cards, and video two-column blocks with wider containers, consistent padding, and fully responsive video embeds.</li></ul><h4>1.3.10</h4><ul><li>Routine validation bump to confirm the branch-archive updater path continues to install cleanly.</li></ul><h4>1.3.9</h4><ul><li>Ensured GitHub branch archives are renamed back to <code>360-global-blocks</code> during updates so the plugin folder never gains a <code>-main</code> suffix.</li></ul><h4>1.3.8</h4><ul><li>Validated the branch-archive updater with an additional smoke-test bump.</li><li>Documented the GitHub-based updater for future reference.</li></ul><h4>1.3.7</h4><ul><li>Synced the latest FTP tweaks and prepped the GitHub release payload.</li></ul><h4>1.3.6</h4><ul><li>Synchronized FTP changes into version control and prepared GitHub release assets.</li></ul><h4>1.3.5</h4><ul><li>Switch to a lightweight, manifest-driven updater compatible with GitHub-hosted ZIP packages.</li><li>Added manifest diagnostics in Tools → 360 Blocks Updates.</li></ul><h4>1.3.4</h4><ul><li>Switched to the Plugin Update Checker library for reliable GitHub updates.</li><li>Synced the Git repository with the live FTP copy and updated diagnostics tooling.</li></ul>"
