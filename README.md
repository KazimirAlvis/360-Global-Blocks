## Changelog

### 1.3.21

- Flattened the Two Column Slider layout on phones with tighter padding, softer shadows, and responsive typography so cards feel more like lightweight callouts
- Automatically hides the slide image below tablet breakpoints to prioritize copy and shrink the overall mobile height without editor tweaks
- Mirrored the responsive rules inside the block editor so authors see the same single-column experience while adjusting content

### 1.3.20

- Prevent duplicate fallback clinics in the Popular Practices block by sampling unique posts and only rendering the slots you have content for
- Auto-center two or three cards with responsive grid sizing and enlarge clinic logo pads to 150px for better brand presentation
- Bundled slider/popular practices metadata in the build output to ensure WordPress recognizes both blocks after updates

### 1.3.19

- Added a per-slide background color picker to the Two Column Slider so each card can carry unique brand accents without custom CSS
- Clamped slider imagery to a 700px max height (with mobile reset) to keep oversized assets from stretching the layout
- Ensured the build pipeline ships the slider `block.json` metadata so existing pages keep rendering after updates

### 1.3.18

- Smoothed the Two Column Text editor experience so columns sit side by side in Gutenberg while still stacking responsibly on smaller breakpoints
- Trimmed grid styling from the wrapper classes that WordPress injects so front-end layouts stay intact without affecting the admin canvas
- Resolved the editor preview error by bundling the block-editor data hooks directly with the block script after the latest enhancements

### 1.3.17

- Introduced the **Two Column Text** block featuring two rich-text columns and per-column background color controls backed by native InnerBlocks
- Registered build tooling and assets for the new block so it ships with npm builds and GitHub updates
- Ensured plugin registration loads the static block automatically without additional render callbacks
- Refined the editor locking so column structure stays fixed while paragraph ‚Üí list transforms and other core conversions remain available

### 1.3.16

- Fixed the two-column block to persist InnerBlocks markup on save so migrated body content renders on the front end without manual HTML tweaks
- Updated the GitHub updater safeguards to retain the mixed-case `360-Global-Blocks` directory name after installs and updates

### 1.3.15

- Hardened the GitHub updater so branch archives are always renamed to `360-global-blocks`, preventing block registration warnings after updates
- Added a safe recursive cleanup helper that removes stray `-main` folders before moving files into place

### 1.3.14

- Adopted core InnerBlocks for the two-column block body, enabling rich text, lists, and other native blocks without custom fields
- Added migration and sanitization logic that moves legacy `bodyText` content into InnerBlocks while stripping duplicate placeholders
- Tightened server and client rendering so the editor preview matches the front end, including refreshed padding and typography

### 1.3.4

- Synced production FTP adjustments back into the repo
- Bumped version to trigger GitHub-powered auto-update

### 1.0.0

-   Initial release
-   8 custom blocks for healthcare websites
-   Health Icons integration
-   PatientReach360 assessment integration
-   Responsive designs for all blocks
