== Description ==
Custom Gutenberg blocks tailored for the 360 network. Includes hero layouts, CTA components, clinic listings, info cards, and PatientReach360 assessment integrations designed for healthcare organizations.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/360-global-blocks/` or install via the Plugins screen.
2. Activate through the Plugins screen.
3. Find the blocks under the "360 Blocks" category in the block editor.

== Release Workflow ==
1. Update `360-global-blocks.php`, `readme.txt`, and `plugin-manifest.json` with the new version, changelog, and compatibility data.
2. Build a ZIP whose root folder is `360-global-blocks` (matching the plugin slug).
3. Publish a tagged GitHub release (e.g. `v1.3.6`) and attach the ZIP as `360-global-blocks.zip`.
4. Point `plugin-manifest.json`'s `download_url` at the release asset and push the manifest to the `main` branch.
5. In any WordPress install, visit Tools â†’ 360 Blocks Updates and click "Force Update Check Now" to confirm the site sees the new version.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin require a GitHub access token? =
No. The updater fetches a JSON manifest over HTTPS. Keep the repository public or host the manifest on an accessible URL. If you make it private, proxy the manifest and ZIP download through an authenticated endpoint.
